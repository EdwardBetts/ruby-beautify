How to contribute to this project.

## Thin rules (to be made into sections)

* Work off the dev branch, not master.
* Pull requests should be named something related to PR, `hotfix-XXX` or `feature-YYY`.
* Do not edit the `version.rb` or the `gemspec`.
* All pull requests have to pass tests on `travis-ci` before I'll consider merging them.

## Formatting and style

Run all your code through `ruby-beautify` with default settings before committing.
